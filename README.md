# Bug-Tracker
Intent is to make a simple ticketing system that can be used to keep track of bugs and other issues. Right now it just reads and writes to text files but everything starts somewhere.
Admittedly pretty sloppy right now. The date as of this writing is 11/22/21 and I wrote practically all of this today, so excuse the jank.
